    CONSOLE APPLICATION : General_Neural_Net_Classification Project Overview
========================================================================

NOTE: Broken, as the sound wave differentiator was wrong, modifications to the source should allow computation of the spiral solving networks.

Basically testing the limits of neural networks ... currently I have implemented a primitive 
spectrum analyzer that correctly returns the frequency identifiers for wave functions comprised
of a sum of 2 waves.
